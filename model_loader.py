model_loader.py — Unified entry point for loading a 3D model file of any
supported format into a clean trimesh.Trimesh, ready for rendering.

Supported formats:
    .obj            - direct trimesh load
    .dae            - direct trimesh load (via pycollada)
    .stl            - direct trimesh load
    .gltf / .glb    - direct trimesh load
    .kn5            - converted via our own from-scratch parser (kn5_reader.py
                       / kn5_to_obj.py) to a temporary OBJ, then loaded normally

Every path strips texture visuals before returning, because trimesh
auto-generates a TextureVisuals object whenever UV coordinates are present
(even with no actual image), and pyrender's texture upload crashes on that
in this environment. We don't need textures for line-art rendering anyway.

    trimesh's scene loader groups faces by MATERIAL, not by the original

    41-group OBJ collapses to ~16 material-based groups under trimesh's
    default loading). This function preserves the real names instead.

    Tolerant of mixed/non-standard line endings and of group lines that
    have a leading space before 'o '/'g ' (both real quirks seen in actual
    exported files during development).

    Also parses 'vt' (UV) lines and each face corner's vt index, needed
    for the UV-space AO bake. Our own kn5_to_obj.py always writes `f
    v/vt/vn` with v==vt==vn for every corner (one UV per source vertex, no
    OBJ-style corner splitting), so the per-vertex UV array this builds is
    exact for KN5-derived files. For a hand-authored/foreign OBJ where the
    same position vertex legitimately has different UVs on different

    a clear explanation if it can't make a confident choice.

    TWO-TIER approach, deliberately not "just guess the biggest file" as
    the only rule, because picking the wrong LOD silently is worse than
    refusing:

    1. AUTHORITATIVE: if the zip contains a `lods.ini` (a real, standard
       Assetto Corsa file — confirmed via AC's own published modding
       pipeline docs — found at any depth, commonly under a `data/`
       folder), parse its `[LOD_0]` section's `FILE=` value. This is the
       mod author's own explicit statement of which file is the highest
       detail model, used by the game itself for the same purpose — by
       far the most trustworthy signal when present, and used whenever it
       is, even if a scoring heuristic might have guessed differently.
    2. FALLBACK: if no usable lods.ini is found, score every supported
       model file in the archive via _score_candidate_for_main_mesh():
       filenames matching a known "this is a lower LOD" pattern (AC's own
       _B/_C/_D suffix convention, generic _LOD1/_LOD2/etc, or keywords
       like "collider"/"low_poly"/"proxy") are penalized heavily; among
       whatever remains, the largest file wins, since a full-detail mesh
       is, by definition, the most complex version of the same car. If
       every candidate has a demotion signal (e.g. a zip containing ONLY
       carname_B.kn5 with no LOD_0 file at all), still pick the
       least-penalized one rather than refusing outright — a worse-than-
       ideal mesh that still loads is more useful than a hard failure,
       but the caller is told via a returned warning so this isn't silent.
